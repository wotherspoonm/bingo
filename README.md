How to load tasks for bingo generator/game

To load tasks for the bingo generator, type out the tasks into a txt file, where
each task is separated by a new line. Ensure that there is no space at the
end of the list and that there are no spaces before a new line.
You also need at least 4 tasks to create the smallest sized bingo board.
An example is shown below:

Do a handstand
Jump 60 times
Do 30 push ups
Hold your breath for 40 seconds

Once the txt file is ready, it can be loaded on the web page and you can generate a bingo
card from it.
